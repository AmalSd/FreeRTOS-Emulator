# FreeRTOS-Graphics-Simulator
An implementation of POSIX based FreeRTOS with the combination of SDL2 graphics. Aimed at providing an x86 simulation solution for teaching FreeRTOS to students without the need of embedded hardware.

Based on the FreeRTOS simulator developed by William Davy.

For those requiring an IDE run "cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ./", an appropriate .gdbinit is in the bin directory.

Work in progress.
